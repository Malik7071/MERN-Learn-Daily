# Introduction to Node.js

Node.js is an open-source, cross-platform JavaScript runtime environment that executes JavaScript code outside a web browser. It allows developers to use JavaScript to write server-side code.

## Why Node.js?
Node.js is popular for its non-blocking, event-driven architecture, making it ideal for building scalable network applications.

## Setting Up Node.js
First, download and install Node.js from the [official website](https://nodejs.org/).

After installation, verify it by checking the Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) versions:

```bash
node --version
npm --version
