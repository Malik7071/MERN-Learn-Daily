# MongoDB Advanced Concepts

Today, we'll dive into more advanced MongoDB features, particularly the Aggregation Framework.

## Key Concepts
- **Aggregation Framework:** Used to process data and return computed results.
- **Pipeline Stages:** Different stages like `$match`, `$group`, and `$sort` to transform data.
- **Accumulators:** Operators like `$sum`, `$avg` that compute values during aggregation.

## Tasks
- Set up an aggregation pipeline to analyze and transform data.
- Use various stages and accumulators to perform complex queries.
