# Asynchronous Operations in Node.js

Explore asynchronous programming in Node.js using callbacks, promises, and async/await.

## Key Concepts
- **Callbacks:** Functions passed as arguments to other functions to execute asynchronously.
- **Promises:** Objects representing the eventual completion or failure of an asynchronous operation.
- **Async/Await:** A modern way to handle asynchronous code, built on top of promises.

## Tasks
- Implement asynchronous operations using callbacks, promises, and async/await.
- Understand error handling in asynchronous code.
