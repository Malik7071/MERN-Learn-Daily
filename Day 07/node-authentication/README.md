# Node.js Authentication

Implement user authentication in Node.js using JWT (JSON Web Tokens).

## Key Concepts
- **JWT (JSON Web Tokens):** A compact way to represent claims between two parties securely.
- **Authentication Flow:** Sign up, login, and token validation process.
- **Middleware:** Validate tokens in requests.

## Tasks
- Implement JWT-based user authentication.
- Create secure login and sign-up routes.
- Protect private routes with JWT token validation.
