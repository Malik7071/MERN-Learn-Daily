# Node.js Clustering

Learn how to scale Node.js applications using clustering to take advantage of multi-core systems.

## Key Concepts
- **Clustering:** Running multiple instances of a Node.js application to handle more requests.
- **Worker Processes:** How worker processes handle incoming requests.
- **Load Balancing:** Distributing the load across multiple worker processes.

## Tasks
- Implement clustering in a Node.js application.
- Create worker processes to handle incoming requests.
- Observe the load balancing behavior in a clustered environment.
