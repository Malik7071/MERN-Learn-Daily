# React Hooks

Explore React hooks and how they can simplify state and side-effect management in functional components.

## Key Concepts
- **useEffect:** Manage side-effects like data fetching, subscriptions, etc.
- **useReducer:** Manage complex state logic using reducers.
- **Custom Hooks:** Create reusable logic by extracting code into custom hooks.

## Tasks
- Implement `useEffect` for fetching data on component mount.
- Use `useReducer` for complex state management in a component.
